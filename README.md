# Open Stygian

The purpose of this project is to create a game engine in Typescript that allows people to create a first person old school RPG in the style of games like Ultima Underworld for the web with support for desktop and mobile clients.

## Compiling

Install the dependencies using npm

```bash
npm install
```
You can transpile the code using

```bash
npm run build
```
If everything worked fine then the game: `build/js/game.js` had been generated, you can now run a server in the build directory.
